# Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review. The body of the skill gives the
one-line policy ("prefer stdlib over new deps"); this file is the
checklist for *adding* a dependency and the workflow for *upgrading* one.

## Before Adding Any Dependency

1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit`)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new
dependencies. Every dependency is a liability.

## Upgrading an Existing Dependency

**Upgrading an existing dependency** is a code change like any other, and
the riskiest upgrades are the ones merged in bulk with a message like
"bump deps." Review them with the same discipline:

1. **Read the changelog, not just the version number.** Semver is a
   promise the maintainer may not have kept — a "patch" can carry a
   behavioral change. For a major bump, read the migration notes and
   find what breaks.
2. **One dependency per change.** Upgrade and merge them individually
   (or in small related groups). When a bulk bump breaks the build,
   you've lost which package did it; a single-package change makes the
   cause obvious and the revert clean.
3. **Let the tests decide.** The upgrade is verified by a green suite
   before *and* after, not by "it installed." If coverage around the
   dependency's behavior is thin, that gap is the real finding — add a
   test first.
4. **Mind the transitive graph.** Most installed packages are ones
   nobody chose directly. Review the lockfile diff, not just
   `package.json`; a single direct bump can pull in dozens of indirect
   changes.
5. **Keep the lockfile honest.** Commit it, review its diff, and never
   hand-edit it. The lockfile is the thing that actually pins what
   ships.

For triaging `npm audit` findings and supply-chain risk (typosquatting,
compromised maintainers), follow the $skill{security-and-hardening} skill
— this file covers the upgrade *workflow*, that one covers the security
verdict.
