# Five-Axis Review Checklist

The body of the skill summarises what each axis asks; this file is the
per-axis checklist to walk through on a real review. Use it to take
notes — pull the questions that apply to the change at hand.

## 1. Correctness

Does the code do what it claims to do?

- [ ] Does it match the spec or task requirements?
- [ ] Are edge cases handled (null, empty, boundary values)?
- [ ] Are error paths handled (not just the happy path)?
- [ ] Does it pass all tests? Are the tests actually testing the right things?
- [ ] Are there off-by-one errors, race conditions, or state inconsistencies?

## 2. Readability & Simplicity

Can another engineer (or agent) understand this code without the author
explaining it?

- [ ] Are names descriptive and consistent with project conventions? (No
  `temp`, `data`, `result` without context)
- [ ] Is the control flow straightforward (avoid nested ternaries, deep
  callbacks)?
- [ ] Is the code organized logically (related code grouped, clear module
  boundaries)?
- [ ] Are there any "clever" tricks that should be simplified?
- [ ] **Could this be done in fewer lines?** (1000 lines where 100 suffice
  is a failure)
- [ ] **Are abstractions earning their complexity?** (Don't generalize
  until the third use case)
- [ ] Would comments help clarify non-obvious intent? (But don't comment
  obvious code.)
- [ ] Are there dead code artifacts: no-op variables (`_unused`),
  backwards-compat shims, or `// removed` comments?
- [ ] **Is a new conditional bolted onto an unrelated flow?** That's a
  design smell, not a nit — push the logic into its own helper, state, or
  policy instead of tangling an existing path.
- [ ] **Do repeated conditionals on the same shape appear?** They signal
  a missing model or dispatcher. A "temporary" branch is usually
  permanent debt.

## 3. Architecture

Does the change fit the system's design?

- [ ] Does it follow existing patterns or introduce a new one? If new,
  is it justified?
- [ ] Does it maintain clean module boundaries?
- [ ] Is there code duplication that should be shared?
- [ ] Are dependencies flowing in the right direction (no circular
  dependencies)?
- [ ] Is the abstraction level appropriate (not over-engineered, not too
  coupled)?
- [ ] **Does this refactor reduce complexity or just relocate it?** Count
  the concepts a reader must hold to follow the change. If a "cleaner"
  version leaves that count unchanged, it isn't cleaner — prefer the
  restructuring that makes whole branches, modes, or layers disappear
  over one that re-centralizes the same logic. Prefer deleting an
  abstraction to polishing it.
- [ ] **Is feature-specific logic leaking into a shared or general-purpose
  module?** Keep logic in its owning layer, reuse the existing canonical
  helper instead of a near-duplicate, and don't normalize architectural
  drift.
- [ ] **Are type boundaries explicit?** Question gratuitous
  `any`/`unknown`/optional/casts and silent fallbacks that paper over an
  unclear invariant — making the boundary explicit often makes the
  surrounding control flow simpler.

## 4. Security

For detailed security guidance, see the $skill{security-and-hardening}
skill. The questions to answer on every change:

- [ ] Is user input validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are secrets kept out of code, logs, and version control?
- [ ] Is authentication/authorization checked where needed?
- [ ] Are SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- [ ] Are outputs encoded to prevent XSS?
- [ ] Are dependencies from trusted sources with no known
  vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Is data from external sources (APIs, logs, user content, config
  files) treated as untrusted?
- [ ] Are external data flows validated at system boundaries before use
  in logic or rendering?

## 5. Performance

For detailed profiling and optimization, see the
$skill{performance-investigation} skill. The questions to answer:

- [ ] Any N+1 query patterns?
- [ ] Any unbounded loops or unconstrained data fetching?
- [ ] Any synchronous operations that should be async?
- [ ] Any unnecessary re-renders in UI components?
- [ ] Any missing pagination on list endpoints?
- [ ] Any large objects created in hot paths?
